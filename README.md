# 3.PoroElastic-comparison-between-PEFIT-2D-plane-strain-and-3D-axisymmetric-cases

Zipped file 1. Poroelastic 2D PEFIT 800 x 89, mesh size dx =1, dy=1 ( Load length varies, HC =0.00 77 in/s fixed)

Zipped file 2. Poroelastic PEFIT 800 x 89, mesh size dx =0.5, dy=0.5 ( Load length fixed (L=1,2,3,4,8), HC varies)

Zipped file 3. MATLAB PLOTS OF ALL RESULTS 

Zipped file 4. 3D case with L=0.5 in/s, HC=0.0077 in/s, mesh size 0.5 in x 0.5 in, load moves 2 grids 

Zipped file 5.1 3D case with r=4 in/s (loading radius), HC=0.0077 in/s, mesh size 1 in x 1 in, load moves 1 grid, hard landing

Zipped file 5.2 3D case with r=4 in/s (loading radius), HC=0.0077 in/s, mesh size 1 in x 1 in, load moves 1 grid, soft landing

AB parameter: 0.00045; loading/unloading: 10E-03; load moves forward two grids at one time, except zipped file 4.

Report 3: By comparing 2D and 3D results, find best parameters ( load length and hydraulic conductivity to make 2D yiled most closet reusslt to 3D case). Load pressure, model size, as well as all other paramters are all fixed ( meaning same as 3D case).
